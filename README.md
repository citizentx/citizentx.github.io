# The Free Insulin Project

An open-source protocol for producing recombinant insulin.

## About
A select few pharmaceutical companies (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi) control all of humanity's access to insulin.

## Design goals
- **Fully open-source**. The latest protocol for producing recombinant insulin will always be public.
- **Powered by Git**.
  - CI/CD actions.
    - Protocols automatically have their commit prepended
    - Automatically generate table of contents from lab notebook
  - Lab notebook will be organized by day, where each experiment is a separate file.
