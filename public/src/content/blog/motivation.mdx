We live in a time of incredible abundance. When we get sick, we're usually able to go to our local pharmacy and purchase medicine that makes us feel better. If necessary, we can go to our doctor and get a prescription that can be filled within the next day. We have built an impressive infrastructure that can provide us with the best medicines almost instantly.

Yet it is fragile. As we experienced with Covid-19, unexpected events can lead to supply chain disruptions that prevent us from accessing life-saving medicines.
