Insulin is an essential medicine for more than 37 million Americans. Yet its high price prevents many from accessing this important medicine. There are a multitude of reasons for insulin's high price, but a key one is this: three companies (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi) and three distributors<Ref id="1" /> (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and Optum Rx) control access to most of the US's supply of insulin.<Ref id="2" />

**We can increase access by increasing supply (and competition).**
